About
======
Keep all modifications as one RUN command, this will cause docker to only
do one layer for all modifications, but keep the original ubuntu image
as one layer. This is the recommended way to flatten docker images.

Build
=======
make all   - Build all docker images.
make <dir> - Build the Dockerfile in <dir>/.

Tagging
=======
Never use the tag *latest* in production, always do a new tag:
docker tag  dockerregistry.westermo.com:443/weos-toolchain:10.0

Push to dockerhub
=================
docker push dockerregistry.westermo.com:443/weos-toolchain
docker push dockerregistry.westermo.com:443/weos-toolchain:10.0
