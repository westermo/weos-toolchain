About
======
Keep all modifications as one RUN command, this will cause docker to only
do one layer for all modifications, but keep the original ubuntu image
as one layer. This is the recomended way to flattern docker images.

Build
=======
docker build --rm -t <user>/weos-toolchain .

Tagging
=======
Never use the tag *latest* in production, always do a new tag:
docker tag <user>/weos-toolchain:10.0

Push to dockerhub
=================
docker push <user>/weos-toolchain
docker push <user>/weos-toolchain:10.0
